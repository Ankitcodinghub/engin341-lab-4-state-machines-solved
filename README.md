In this lab students will use State Machines to design a Traffic Light Controller for an intersection with a main street, a side street, and a pedestrian crossing. The resulting output will be displayed using a series of LEDs on a proto-board connected via ZYBO PMOD ports.

Figure 1. Traffic Light Diagram

Traffic Light A should consist of 3 lights: Green (Ga), Yellow (Ya), and Red (Ra) Traffic Light B should consist of 3 lights: Green (Gb), Yellow (Yb), and Red (Rb) The Pedestrian Crossing should consist of 2 lights: White (Ww) and Red (Rw)

A Maintenance Mode will also be implemented. When Maintenance Mode is active, all three lights (R, Y, G) for each traffic light (A, B, P) should flash at 1Hz. When Maintenance Mode is switched off, all lights should reset to the starting mode of (Ga, Rb, Rw).

Extra Credit: Modify your design so that the Pedestrian Crossing only occurs when a ‚Äúwalk‚Äù button is pressed. In this case, the main sequence should only cycle through the sequence below when operating as normal. You will use the onboard pushbuttons to determine when walk has been pressed and released. Once this occurs, enable an on-board LED to indicate that the Pedestrian crossing is enabled. At the end of the next sequence, the walk sequence described in Tables 1 and 2 should occur. After the walk sequence, the on-board LED should turn off and the sequence should return to the sequence below.

Part 1. State Graphs

You have been given some room for creativity with this lab. The main requirements are that the ‚ÄúTraffic Lights‚Äù your program controls must follow the sequence given with the specified timing, and it must implement a maintenance mode.

With this in mind, you can approach the problem in a couple of different ways. You could have a single large state machine that controls all three sets of lights, or a state machine for each set of lights. Whichever direction you go in, make sure that it is reflected in your FSM graph, and then your ASM chart. A simple example of a state graph and its state machine chart equivalent are shown below in Figures 2 and 3.

Part 2. State Machines in VHDL

In VHDL, State Machines are implemented inside processes sensitive to a clock and/or a reset signal, using a combination of ‚Äòif‚Äô and ‚Äòcase‚Äô statements. To the right is an example of a VHDL implementation of the simple State Machine shown in Figures 1 and 2.

The first line to take note of is the ‚ÄúTYPE statetype is (S0, S1);‚Äù. This is a TYPE declaration, and its purpose is to create a new enumerated data type. In this case, we have created a new data type called statetype, which only has two enumerated values, S0 and S1, equivalent to the integer values of 0 and 1 respectively. Any signals/variables that are declared as statetype can only assume one of the two (S0 or S1) enumerated values. For example, on the next line, is a signal declaration, ‚ÄúSIGNAL state : statetype;‚Äù. We have now created an internal signal of type statetype, which can change its value between S0 and S1. The state signal is a state register, because it only changes on a clock edge, and is used to store the present state value. The next state value of the state register is determined within the case statement inside the FSM process, based on conditional statements encapsulated by if/elsif/else statements.

This method of state encoding using

enumerated data types is called enumerated

state encoding. Rather than explicitly encoding

each state to a series of bits, which yields hard-

to-read VHDL code, especially for large FSMs, using enumerated state encoding allows Vivado‚Äôs Synthesis tool to set the actual state bit encodings according to the synthesis options at synthesis time.

The X_Out process (sensitive only to the state signal, which in turn changes only on a rising clock edge) defines the behavior of the output signal x. This is an example of a Moore-type state machine. The output of Mealy-type state machines would be sensitive to both the current state and the explicit state machine inputs.

Part 3. Top Level Design Implementation

Your top level file should, at a minimum, contain modules for your clock divider and traffic controller. You can either directly connect the output of your Traffic Controller module to the output of your Top level file. Or you can implement an LED driver.

Part 4. Designing the Constraints

When designing your constraints file, make sure to consider which PMOD connector on the ZYBO you will be using. This will affect your pin assignments.

This design contains three inputs. For your mode input, you should use SW0 on the ZYBO, and for the reset, you can use one of the onboard buttons.

Part 5. Connecting to the ZYBO PMOD Ports

You are expected to put together a ‚ÄúTraffic Light‚Äù circuit, containing a set of LEDs for Street A, Street B, and the Pedestrian Crossing. This is a simple circuit, but you are also expected to connect this circuit via jumpers/wires to one of the PMOD ports on the ZYBO.

Figure 4. Port Numbering for PMOD Connectors

As shown in the ZYBO Reference Manual, a single PMOD connector has 12 ports. The ports you should be using are J1-J4, and J7-J10, as well as either J5 or J11 for your ground. J6 or J12 provide Vcc.

It is important that your circuit wiring and connection to the PMOD ports matches your constraint files. Refer to the ZYBO Reference Manual for the pin numbers of whichever set of PMOD ports you use.
